# Voice Assistant with GUI

This project is a voice-activated assistant with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python. The assistant can handle information retrieval and video playing requests using speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: The assistant listens to user commands and responds with voice output.
- **Information Retrieval**: The assistant can search for information online and provide results.
- **Video Playback**: The assistant can search for and play videos on YouTube.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A simple GUI allows the user to interact with the assistant using buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Django**: Web framework used for creating a robust back-end.
- **pyttsx3**: Text-to-Speech conversion library in Python.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs.
- **tkinter**: Standard GUI library for Python.
- **Selenium**: WebDriver for automating web applications for testing purposes.
- **WebDriver Manager**: For managing browser drivers (ChromeDriver in this case).

python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Entry point for the voice assistant functionality.
- **selenium_web.py**: Contains the `InfoScraper` class for web scraping.
- **YT_auto.py**: Contains the `YouTubePlayer` class for playing YouTube videos.
- **index.py**: Contains the `VoiceAssistant` class for the GUI.
